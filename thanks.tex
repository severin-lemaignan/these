\noindent

One thesis, two places,

Three robots and four years,

Rachid and Michael sailing forward

On the merry-go-rounds of robotics.

Bears and bards, all the troupe of PhD students,

A wife and a daughter, a life and some science,

The rose city and all these friends

Who tile the world with colours,

\vspace{1em}

To all of you, thank you!
