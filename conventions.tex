\chapter*{\centering \begin{normalsize}Conventions and Notations\end{normalsize}}

This thesis relies on several notations and specific writing conventions to describe symbolic
knowledge and logical relations.

Ontologies and excerpts of ontologies presented in the work are mostly written
in the W3C's OWL language. As a derivative of XML, it uses \emph{namespaces} to
declare the scopes of concepts. The main namespaces that are used in this work
are {\tt owl:}, {\tt rdf:}, {\tt rdfs:}, {\tt cyc:} (for concepts defined in the
{\sc OpenCyc} upper ontology) and {\tt oro:} (for the concepts defined in our
work). For readability, the namespaces will be omitted when they are not
required for the understanding.

The table below summarizes the terminology that is used in this work to discuss
knowledge representation questions. While these terms are generally not
strictly synonyms, we will use them interchangeabily when no confusion may
arise.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}|p{3.5cm}}
\toprule
Concept, \par Entity, \par Element & Class (OWL), \par Concept (DL) & Relation, \par Property (OWL), Role (DL), \par (Binary) Predicate & Instance (OWL), Individual (DL) \\
\bottomrule

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Description Logic terminology (noted DL above) for classes and relations will
be used only in the specific context of Description Logic. In other cases, the
term \emph{concept} will encompass \emph{classes}, \emph{properties} and
\emph{instances} in the OWL terminology.

In our context, a logical \emph{statement} is both a declarative sentence and
the meaning of this sentence (in this case, it is a \emph{fact} or a
\emph{belief}). The acception of the term \emph{statement} will depend on the
context of use. Furthermore, statements are generally represented as
\emph{triples} $\langle subject, predicate, object \rangle$. Statements that are
explicitely added to a knowledge base are called \emph{assertions}.

The terms \emph{statement}, \emph{assertion}, \emph{fact}, \emph{belief},
\emph{triple} are thus frequently used with similar meanings.

Single concepts are typeset with this font: \concept{concept}, while statements
are typeset in this way: \stmt{subject predicate object}.

Relations between concepts and rules rely on logical connectors. The table
below presents the most important ones that are found in this thesis.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
$\sqcap$ & intersection or conjunction of classes \\
$\sqcup$ & union or disjunction of classes \\
$\forall$ & universal restriction \\
$\exists$ & existential restriction \\
$\equiv$ & class equivalence \\
$\emptyset$ & empty set \\
\midrule
$\land$ & logical AND \\
$\lor$ & logical OR \\
$\to$ & implication \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Finally, we may use the Manchester
Syntax\footnote{\url{http://www.co-ode.org/resources/reference/manchester_syntax/}}
to present in a readable way certain more complex class expressions.
